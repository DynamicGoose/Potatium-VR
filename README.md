# Potatium-VR
Trying to make open source modular system for sense feedback in VR
# The Plan
The plan is to develop firmware for devboards and drivers as well as our own hardware you can build yourself, but also allow different hardware in case you want to develop your own hardware or use other hardware with the Potatium ecosystem.
#disclaimer
development has just started and the files on GitHub are not ready to be used!

firmware is not finished and is currently being developed to work with the D1 mini dev board

firmware is located in the Potatium-Firmware branch
